This project implements a 16-stage, 8-bit wide First-In-First-Out (FIFO) memory using Verilog. FIFO memory is a type of data buffer or queue where the first data written is the first data read, similar to a queue in software programming. It is commonly used in digital systems to manage data flow between processes that operate at different rates or with varying latency requirements
